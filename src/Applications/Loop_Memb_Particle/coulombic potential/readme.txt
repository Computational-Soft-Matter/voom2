All the results in this folder were obtained using:

- Mesh with 2562 nodes
- kappa (bending stiffness) = 1 (units of pair potential strength)
- pair potential strength = 1 unit
- Volume constraint = 0.85*4/3pi (oops! I should have checked the vol const before running all the simulations!)
- penatly parameter = 1000
- lambda (Gauge fixing parameter) = 10
