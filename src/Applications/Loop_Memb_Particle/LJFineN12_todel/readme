Lambda = 10
Sigma =  2*sqrt(4.0/12); epsilonLJ=1
No reduced volume constraint.
Projected gradient less than 1e-4.
Kappa decreased from 1 to 0.05 in increments of 0.05
So,
N12_kappa1_lambda20_0 corresponds to kappa=1
N12_kappa1_lambda20_1 corresponds to kappa=0.95
N12_kappa1_lambda20_2 corresponds to kappa=0.90

.
N12_kappa1_lambda20_10 corresponds to kappa=0.05

Since the states were computed using "sort-of" numerical continuation (i.e., use previous state as guess for new state), icosahedral symmetry has been maintained even for small kappa. This is most likely a meta stable state.
