Lambda = 2
epsLJ = 0.1
Sigma =  2*sqrt(4.0/12); 
No reduced volume constraint.
Projected gradient less than 1e-4.
Kappa decreased from 3 to 0.025 in decrements of 0.025
And then kappa is decreased in decrements of 0.0025

Since the states were computed using "sort-of" numerical continuation (i.e., use previous state as guess for new state), icosahedral symmetry has been maintained even for small kappa. This is most likely a meta stable state.
